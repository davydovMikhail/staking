# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Staking address = '0xE8eC86751797327043cE64C3ab091Fa8771bD925'
LP-token address = '0xA705a06aD314496271BD4Eba3d8766D9955F6D5a'
Reward-token address = '0x9eB02B48372d2B3335CE78362a65Ab6B5863Ed25'
